# mind manual

For many years, in the course of practice, I have collected various teachings, meditations and other good Dharma practices.

This is the latest ongoing project and is of a literary style typical of open source technical manuals. In this way, it can be seen as a free and open source "meditation manual" although this word "meditation" will likely change in meaning during the coarse of studying and practicing it.

I have set out to correct certain fundamental errors in how Buddhism broadly, and meditation specifically, have been contextualized for readers of modern English. While the modern context in which these errors are said to appear is "new" the errors themselves are quite old, having been extensively covered in prior generations of Dharma transmission throughout Asia. As such, I have tried to limit the degree to which I speak or comment on these ideas and instead have collected and organized numerous works from the Buddhist canon to illustrate what has already been said.

In this I have presented, continue to present, and will present in the future many new translations, some of which may never have appeared in English.

This project is written in "native HTML," which is something you don't hear much. HTML is a protocol standard for the Web documents and applications that is implemented in Browsers and embedded in nearly every computer operating system in the world that displays interfaces on a screen. As such, it is heavily relied upon but in recent years is compiled "into" rather than being "authored in."

However, I'm an old hacker, and modern AI assistants are much more adept at building for standards than the numerous tools people use to compile into them, so writing both the semantics, logic, and interactions along with the actual text into HTML (and maybe a little JavaScript) is the most useful method.

This means that, this is not a "book" and would probably not compile into one very easily, as sections are embedded by reference throughout which would read as mass duplication in a printed form. Those with experience in Dharma study may appreciate this quality, as it allows the free form linking of ideas which represent something much closer to the image of Indra's Net than what can be serialized to material in linear sequence.
